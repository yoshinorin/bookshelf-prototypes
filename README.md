# Bookshelf

> [Live](https://bookshelf.yoshinorin.net/): The current stacks are not yet related to this repository's stacks. But, I'm going to migrate new stacks. (from `Vue 2.x, Vuetiry 1.x` to `Vue3.x, Nuxt.js 3.x, Vuetify 3.x`)

## Purpose

- Migrate stacks
    - `Vue 2.x, Vuetiry 1.x` to `Vue3.x, Nuxt.js 3.x, Vuetify 3.x`
        - Honestly, I do not want to use JS/TS stacks, but I don't have much time to try other stacks. So, I decide to use JS/TS stacks for the front-end.
- Publish to public repository
    - The current source code (`Vue 2.x, Vuetiry 1.x`) is private repos manages. I want to migrare to public repositories.
